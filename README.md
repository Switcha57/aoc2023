# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges! This repository contains my solutions to the challenges, all of which are written in Python.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers around the world come together to solve a series of programming challenges. Each day from December 1st to 25th, a new challenge is released. Each challenge has two parts, and for each part you solve, you earn a star. The goal is to collect as many stars as possible.

## Objective

The objective of this repository is to earn a star for every challenge. But more than that, it's about learning and growing as a programmer. Advent of Code is a fantastic opportunity to improve problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms, and for me to get more comfortable with Python.

## Challenges

The challenges will be added to this repository as they are completed. Stay tuned!

## Contributing
